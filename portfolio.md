## Letter

April 25, 2022

Dear panelists,

I am a journalist-developer who tells data-driven stories visually — often with code. But growing up, I never thought I’d have a hyphenated identity. 

I grew up in India in what I think was an interesting time: On the one hand, my country was making huge leaps toward globalization, but on the other, its democratic institutions were riddled with corruption, which often manifested in violence based on caste and religion. The desire to hold power to account drew me into journalism, with the goal of making information more accessible and understandable for an average reader. The open-mindedness of my family gave me the opportunity to pursue my college education in the United States. After taking a course in informatics in college, however, I realized the ability to leverage computational techniques helped me analyze data sets and find and develop story ideas. 

In order to hone my skills in data and computational journalism, I decided to attend graduate school, and came to the University of Maryland in the fall of 2020.

I learned at Merrill College that I enjoy collaborating on [data-driven investigations](https://cnsmaryland.org/essential-and-exposed/), developing [data pipelines](https://actions-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and building [graphics](https://aadittambe.com/#work) for long-form stories. I also learned that I want to leverage my programming skills to build tools and applications to support the work of data and graphics journalists. 

As a current fellow at the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, I work on the data team writing web scrapers, developing automated resources for data collection and building interactive graphics for editorial projects. My work demonstrates my commitment to figuring out programming concepts I may not know, to produce informative and engaging projects. For example, while working on a project last year about a surge in travelers during Thanksgiving, I wanted to track how many people were [flying in real time](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/11/18/tracking-air-travel-see-how-many-people-are-flying-this-thanksgiving/). Instead of setting up a server to run a web scraper which would cost money, I taught myself how to use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/aadittambe/thanksgiving-travel) to schedule a script and log new data every day, and use the data to power visualizations. Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to co-teach a [three-hour hands-on](https://palewi.re/docs/first-github-scraper/) class at NICAR this year on how to scrape a dataset using the free tool. 

Last summer, I interned on the [data and graphics team at NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/datagraphics), which gave me the opportunity to pitch and report data-driven stories, and write JavaScript to develop data visualizations that explained the news visually. I also created charts, maps, and graphics using charting libraries such as D3 for breaking news stories under strict deadlines.

My work has helped people understand the news and make sense of the policies that impact them, often through graphics and design. I have used my programming skills to help tell engaging stories. And it's what I intend to continue doing after graduation, and to that end, I have accepted an internship at The Washington Post on the graphics and design team for the summer. 

In terms of short-term goals, I know I can do more to make my web design and data visualization more accessible, from writing cleaner markup to adding alt text to images, to thinking about how users may navigate a page. More than 1 billion people worldwide (including 26 million in the U.S.) [have a disability](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health), and I want to work harder to cater to their data journalism needs. Additionally, I am always strengthening my D3 knowledge and familiarity with web frameworks, so I hope to continue that.

In the long term, I want to focus on creating products that support the storytelling ambitions of journalists. While this goal is still a work-in-progress, I think a few years down the line I want to work on behind-the-scenes technologies for newsrooms, building digital tools and applications for investigative reporters and news designers, as well as custom presentations for the web. 

Merrill College gave me the opportunity to produce real-world journalism — as a Howard fellow, working at Capital News Service and interning at NBC News — and I embraced the hyphenated journalist-developer identity. I am excited use my skills and continue exploring how graphics and data-driven storytelling can enrich journalism. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my M.J. Day portfolio — should you have any questions about my experience or qualifications, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Aadit Tambe
